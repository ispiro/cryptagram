<body>
<p>You have been invited to take part in a research study about the usability of an image privacy tool called Cryptagram. This study will be conducted by Ian Spiro through the Department of Computer Science in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University, as part of his doctoral dissertation research. The faculty sponsor is Christoph Bregler, associate professor in the Computer Science Department in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University.
If you agree to be in this study, you are consenting to the remote logging of certain non-identifying data generated during your usage of the Cryptagram tool. This includes things such as:
<ol>
<li>Logs of when and how many images are encoded or decoded.</li>
<li>The method and configuration chosen to encode images.</li>
<li>General information about the context in which an image was decoded.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>We will not log or record any passwords, and will record no image data. We will record a signature of each image file that is used for internal indexing. We will not record any IP addresses or the specific URLs on which the software is used. We may ask you to complete a short survey related to image privacy and the Cryptagram project but your responses will be recorded anonymously.</p>

<p>Participation in this study will involve a variable amount of time, depending on how long you use the extension or application.</p>

<p>There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life.</p>

<p>Although you will receive no direct benefits from participating, this research may help the investigator further the understanding of practical encryption software.</p>

<p>Note that the research team cannot see the images that are encrypted using Cryptagram and therefore cannot screen them for appropriateness. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for content provided by users of the tool. You bear the entire risk of the completeness, accuracy or usefulness of content encrypted or decrypted with this tool.</p>

<p>You agree that you will be personally responsible for your use of the tool and for all of your communication and activity employing its protocol, including any content you contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless New York University from any liability or damages arising from your conduct with Cryptagram, including any content that you contribute. Online conduct should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette.</p>

<p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.

<p>If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, or if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact Ian Spiro at ian.spiro@nyu.edu, (212) 998-3327, 719 Broadway, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10003 or the faculty sponsor, Christoph Bregler at chris.bregler@nyu.edu, (212) 998-3208, 719 Broadway, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10003.</p>

<p>For questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects, New York University, 665 Broadway, Suite 804, New York, NY 10012 at (212) 998-4808 or ask.humansubjects@nyu.edu.</p>
